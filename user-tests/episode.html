          "reviewBody": "I have never seen the original show with Richard Chamberlain, or read the source material, so i have nothing to compare it to, and this is my first experience with this story!\n\nThe thing that struck me the most, was how authentic and well made it is! This the kind of stuff i miss sometimes! When the people behind has a clear vision and you can feel the ambition and love for the source material!\n\nHuge plus to have the japanese characters speak japanese! It really feels like you are transported back to 1600 Japan!\n\nA nice introduction to the characters as well! Blackthornes journey has potential to be very interesting! The japanese characters are great as well! The actors are going all out!\n\nThe story has great potential to with Blackthorne trying to survive in a foreign country with a political powergame in the making!\n\nDefinnitely has potential, its unique, authentic and nothing quite like anything else!",
